index-FINISHED.html is the author's version of the drum kit and index-START is my version of it.

The drum kit allows you to press any key that is displayed on the page to play sounds along with animation.
I added the ability to click on the keys on the page to play the sound and animation using the same playSound function. In order to do this, I had to redesign the event handlers and the playSound function so that the event handlers would determine the "keycode" to be passed as an argument to playSound.
